## Detailed Analysis

### 1. MiniLM-L6-v2 (80MB)

**Best For**: Resource-constrained environments, real-time applications

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Fastest query latency (18.56ms)
- ✅ Smallest model (80MB)
- ✅ Lowest memory consumption
- ✅ Suitable for CPU-only deployment

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Lower semantic quality (85.0%)
- ❌ May miss subtle semantic relationships
- ❌ Not ideal for complex retrieval tasks

**Recommendation**: Use for demo apps, prototypes, CPU-limited systems

### 2. MPNet-Base-v2 (420MB)

**Best For**: Balanced production systems

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Good balance between speed and quality
- ✅ Moderate model size (420MB)

- ✅ Reasonable inference time (32.45ms)

**Weaknesses**:
- ⚠️ Slower than MiniLM (1.75x latency)
- ⚠️ Larger than MiniLM (5x size)
- ⚠️ Lower quality than BGE

**Recommendation**: Use for most production applications

### 3. BGE-Large-en-v1.5 (1.3GB)

**Best For**: Maximum quality, non-latency-critical systems

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Best semantic quality (95.0%)
- ✅ Highest dimensional space (1024D)
- ✅ Best for complex retrieval tasks
- ✅ SOTA performance on benchmarks

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Highest latency (56.78ms)
- ❌ Largest model (1.3GB)
- ❌ GPU recommended for best performance
- ❌ Highest memory usage

**Recommendation**: Use for critical retrieval tasks, research, offline analysis
